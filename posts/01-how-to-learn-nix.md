There is much consensus, that Nix lacks good learning resources. 

An incomplete list (write me if any resource is missing):

* (official) https://nixos.org/learn/
* (official) https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/
* (inofficial) [NixOS & Flakes Book](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-and-flakes-book) Â© 2023 by Ryan Yin 
* (inofficial) https://tonyfinn.com/blog/nix-from-first-principles-flake-edition/
* (inofficial?) https://github.com/spacekookie/learning-nix

For this reason, I decided to go ahead and start my own learning process :)
